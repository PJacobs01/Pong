# Pong 

### Project Overview
This is my attempt to recreate pong and is my first programming project. Pong is a basic video game but is an excellent
starting position to learn how to program using the Pygame module. It is useful as it helps teach basic practices of coding such as functions and 
loops. Once the framework has been defined then Pygame allows for aesthetic creativity which can further be built upon.


### Installation instructions
   
Import the following python modules:
- pygame
- sys
- ball as b
- player as p 
- random

Code should be able to run if executed in its current form.

User can customise project as much as possible. If amended please comment extensively when pushed.
